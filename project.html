    <h1>Information technology (IT) </h1>
    <p>
        is the use of computers to create, process, store, retrieve and exchange all kinds of data[1] and 
        information. IT forms part of information and communications technology (ICT).[2] An information 
        technology system (IT system) is generally an information system, a communications system, or, more 
        specifically speaking, a computer system — including all hardware, software, and peripheral equipment — 
        operated by a limited group of IT users.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although humans have been storing, retrieving, manipulating, and communicating information since the earliest
         writing systems were developed,[3] the term information technology in its modern sense first appeared in a 
         1958 article published in the Harvard Business Review; authors Harold J. Leavitt and Thomas L.
         Whisler commented that "the new technology does not yet have a single established name. We shall call it 
         information technology (IT)."[4] Their definition consists of three categories: techniques for processing, 
         the application of statistical and mathematical methods to decision-making, and the simulation of higher-order 
         thinking through computer programs.[4]

The term is commonly used as a synonym for computers and computer networks, but it also encompasses other
 information distribution technologies such as television and telephones. Several products or services within 
 an economy are associated with information technology, including computer hardware, software, electronics, 
 semiconductors, internet, telecom equipment, and e-commerce.[5][a]
